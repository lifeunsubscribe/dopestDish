This project will use a virtual environment.
It is not saved on the repository. This helps us avoid source control issues.
For this reason, you must set up the venv yourself to run dopestDish.
do this using the following steps
	1. clone the repository to your local directory and navigate (cd) into it using command line
	2. the project folder will contain this README and requirements.txt (check with "dir" or "ls")
	3. from here, the Windows command for creating virtual env is "python -m venv venv/"
	4. to activate venv on Windows, use "venv\Scripts\activate"
	5. After activation, the commandline will start with "(venv)"
	6. Make sure the venv is activated and write "pip install -r requirements.txt"
